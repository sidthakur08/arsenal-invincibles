# Arsenal Invincibles
Hopefully an "in-depth" review of the 2003/04 Arsenal Invincibles. Yeah it's on a "hopefully" area but I'll be looking forward to analyse their performance on a basic level.

### Shot maps
- Games<br>
Plotted the shots with goals containing the names of the scorers and the expected goals as provided by the statsbomb data for all 32 of 38 games played by Arsenal in the 2003/04 season.
- Players<br>
Plotted the individual player shots of goals, no goals and both. Thierry Henry and Robert Pires are the ones with most shots and goals.
- ExpectedGoals(xG) vs Shot Count<br>
Some inference can be generated about the types and amounts of chances created by Arsenal and the opposition team in a single match by plotting a line plot between the xG of a shot and the frequency of shots
